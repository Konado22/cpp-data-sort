# Algorithms and Data Structures: cpp-data-sort 

## Goals
This projects aim was an enhancement of previous work completed in CS-300. In this course we learned about various data structure in C++ and characteristics of these structures. The final project for this course was to create a data structure to store data read from an external CSV file. By creating this data structure and implementing the methodology to iterate through it, we also were tasked with justifying our descision to include the specific data structure we chose. Upon reflection and enhancements of this artifact I have transitioned to a binary tree structure rather than a standard vector. Below I have provided a list of enhancements performed to the artifact in line with course objectives that best showcases my work within data structures and algorithms within the SNHU computer science program.
<ul>
  <li>Transition from vector to Binary Tree</li>
  <li>Implmement functionality to iterate through tree</li>
  <li>Include parser file to create objects</li>
  <li>Build functionality to measure time performance of the programs execution</li>
</ul>
